## Introduction
A simple product analytics project for a bike sharing company, that is aimed at evaluating key factors influencing the revenue, cost and profit of the company.

## Data Sources
Bike Share Data: The 'bike_share_yr_0.csv' and 'bike_share_year_1.csvn' files contain important information such as the Date, Month, Season, Hour, temperature, windspeed, humidity, biker type and biker count.
Cost Data: The 'cost_table.csv' file contains the basic product price information such as year, price and cost of goods sold.

## Technologies
* MS Excel
* MySQL Workbench 8.0 CE
* MS PowerBI

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions such as:

- What is the yearly, quarterly and monthly profit and revenue trends for the years 2021, 2022?
- What are the weather conditions that influence rider count and how?
- What is the most common rider type?
- Where there any peaks in rider count and when? Was the decision of increasing the product price correct?

## Data Analysis-Visualization


## Results/Findings
1. The profit was slightly smaller than the revenue, which points to a minimal cost of goods sold.
2. The temperature greatly affected the number of riders, with the riders preffering low to mid-high temperatures(20-80 percent of the highest temperature recorded) with the most preffered being 70 percent, totaling 177.298 riders total.
3. The most common rider type was registered(81.17%) while the casual type came in at just 18.83%.
4. The total rider count was significantly higher in 2022 compared to 2021(2.049.576 to 1.243.103 riders) and peaked in the summer-fall season, particularly August and September.
5. In the year 2022 the profit had more than doubled(!) compared to 2021(10.200.134 to 4.938.541 dollars) 

## Recommendations
Based on the results of our analysis, we recommend the following actions:
  - The decision that had been made to increase the price of the product by 1 dollar was excellent, provided there was a doubling of profit, while the cost of goods sold increased just 32 cents per product.
  - Given that summer-fall season and particularly August and September were the peak profit months, it is appropriate to find ways to further increase the profit in those months.
  - There should be more bikes available in the years to come, given the dramatic increase in the rider count.

## Limitations
The datasets were already clean and so no data cleaning took place.
